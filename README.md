# artWatch

A virtual silent auction.

## User Story

I'm a struggling artist that wants to get my work in front of potential buyers without the high cost of renting physical gallery space. 

## Description

This site allows artist to showcase their work. The artist can upload their latest artwork and buyers can bid on it or "watch" it. Once the bidding has closed out the artist can remove the information for the pieces they sold and load more if need be. Buyers can create an account and add/remove art from their "wishlist". Once the winning bid is determined, the winning buyer can easily pay online.
