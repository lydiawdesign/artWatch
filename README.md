# artWatch

This site allows artists and/or gallerists to showcase original work for sale digitally. Potential art buyers can create an account on artWatch to bid on or "watch" art for sale. The wishlist functionality is available to art buyers that have an account on artwatch; buyers are able to add, remove, or view art that they have in their "wishlist". Buyers are also able to "bid" on art by submitting their bid price with a the click of a few buttons. Highest bid wins the art!

## User Story

I'm a struggling artist that wants to get my work in front of potential buyers without the high cost of renting physical gallery space. 

AS AN art buyer
I WANT to buy the best art for the cheapest prices online by bidding
SO THAT I can support a virtual art gallery and artists.
